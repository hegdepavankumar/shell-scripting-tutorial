# Pattern Matching and Text Processing with `grep`, `sed`, and `awk` in Linux

Pattern matching and text processing are common tasks in Linux scripting. Commands like `grep`, `sed`, and `awk` are powerful tools for handling these tasks efficiently. This tutorial will guide you through the usage of these commands in a Linux environment.

## `grep` - Global Regular Expression Print

### Basic Usage

The `grep` command is widely used for searching patterns in files. The basic syntax is:

```bash
grep PATTERN FILE
```

For example, to search for the word "error" in a file:

```bash
grep "error" logfile.txt
```

### Options

- `-i`: Ignore case.
- `-r`: Recursively search subdirectories.
- `-n`: Show line numbers.
- `-v`: Invert match, i.e., show lines not matching the pattern.

```bash
grep -i -n "warning" -r /path/to/directory
```

## `sed` - Stream Editor

### Basic Usage

The `sed` command is a stream editor that can perform basic text transformations. The basic syntax is:

```bash
sed 's/old_text/new_text/g' filename.txt
```

For example, to replace "apple" with "orange" in a file:

```bash
sed 's/apple/orange/g' fruits.txt
```

### Options

- `-i`: Edit files in place.
- `-e`: Specify multiple commands.

```bash
sed -i 's/old/new/g' file.txt
```

## `awk` - Text Processing Tool

### Basic Usage

The `awk` command is a versatile tool for text processing. The basic syntax is:

```bash
awk 'PATTERN { COMMAND }' FILE
```

For example, to print the second and fourth columns of a file:

```bash
awk '{ print $2, $4 }' data.txt
```

### Options

- `-F`: Specify a field separator.

```bash
awk -F':' '{ print $1 }' /etc/passwd
```

## Combining `grep`, `sed`, and `awk`

### Example Scenario

Let's say you have a log file and you want to find all lines containing the word "error," replace "error" with "warning," and then print the timestamp and error message.

```bash
grep "error" logfile.txt | sed 's/error/warning/g' | awk '{print $1, $2, $3, $4, $5}'
```

In this example, `grep` filters lines with "error," `sed` replaces "error" with "warning," and `awk` extracts the timestamp and error message columns.

### Practical Example - Extracting IP Addresses

Let's use `grep`, `sed`, and `awk` to extract IP addresses from a log file:

```bash
grep -oE "\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b" access.log | sed 's/\./-/g' | awk '{print "IP Address: " $1}'
```

This example combines `grep` with a regular expression to find IP addresses, `sed` to replace dots with hyphens, and `awk` to format the output.

## Conclusion

Mastering `grep`, `sed`, and `awk` is essential for effective pattern matching and text processing in Linux scripting. Whether you are searching for specific patterns, replacing text, or extracting information from files, these commands provide powerful solutions. Experiment with different options and combinations to tailor these tools to your specific scripting needs.
