# Case Statements in Linux Shell Scripting

In Linux shell scripting, the `case` statement is a powerful tool for handling multiple conditions in a more readable and structured way. It provides an alternative to a series of `if-elif-else` statements when dealing with different values of a variable.

## 1. Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of a `case` statement in bash is as follows:

```bash
case variable in
    pattern1)
        # code to be executed if variable matches pattern1
        ;;
    pattern2)
        # code to be executed if variable matches pattern2
        ;;
    pattern3)
        # code to be executed if variable matches pattern3
        ;;
    *)
        # code to be executed if variable matches none of the patterns
        ;;
esac
```

## 2. Example Usage

### 2.1. Simple Case Statement

```bash
#!/bin/bash

fruit="apple"

case $fruit in
    "apple")
        echo "It's a delicious apple."
        ;;
    "orange")
        echo "It's a juicy orange."
        ;;
    "banana")
        echo "It's a ripe banana."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Unknown fruit."
        ;;
esac
```

### 2.2. Case Statement with Pattern Ranges

```bash
#!/bin/bash

score=85

case $score in
    [90-100])
        echo "Excellent! You scored an A."
        ;;
    [80-89])
        echo "Good job! You scored a B."
        ;;
    [70-79])
        echo "Not bad. You scored a C."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "You need to improve."
        ;;
esac
```

### 2.3. Case Statement with Wildcards

```bash
#!/bin/bash

file="example.txt"

case $file in
    *.txt)
        echo "It's a text file."
        ;;
    *.pdf)
        echo "It's a PDF document."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Unknown file type."
        ;;
esac
```

## 3. Notes

- Each pattern should end with `;;` to indicate the end of that particular case.
- The `*)` at the end serves as the default case, similar to the `else` statement in `if-elif-else` constructs.
- Use of square brackets allows for pattern matching using ranges or wildcards.

These examples illustrate the basic usage of `case` statements in Linux shell scripting. You can customize and expand upon these templates based on your specific requirements and use cases.
