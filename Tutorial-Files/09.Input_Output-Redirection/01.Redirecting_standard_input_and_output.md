# Input/Output Redirection in Linux Scripting

Input/Output (I/O) redirection in Linux scripting allows you to control where data comes from and where it goes, enhancing the flexibility of your scripts. This tutorial will guide you through the usage of input and output redirection in a Linux environment.

## Output Redirection

### Redirecting Standard Output (`stdout`)

Standard Output is the default channel for a command's output. You can redirect it to a file using the `>` operator:

```bash
command > output.txt
```

This will overwrite the content of `output.txt` with the output of the `command`. To append the output to the file without overwriting, use `>>`:

```bash
command >> output.txt
```

### Redirecting Standard Error (`stderr`)

Standard Error is the default channel for error messages. You can redirect it similarly to Standard Output:

```bash
command 2> error.log
```

This redirects error messages from `command` to `error.log`. To redirect both Standard Output and Standard Error to the same file, you can use:

```bash
command > output_and_error.log 2>&1
```

## Input Redirection

### Redirecting Standard Input (`stdin`)

Standard Input is the default channel for a command's input. You can redirect it from a file using the `<` operator:

```bash
command < input.txt
```

This will take the content of `input.txt` and use it as input for `command`.

### Using a Here Document

A Here Document allows you to provide input directly within the script:

```bash
command <<EOF
This is
a Here Document
EOF
```

## Combining Input and Output Redirection

You can combine input and output redirection in a single command. For example, to take input from `input.txt` and write both output and errors to `output.log`:

```bash
command < input.txt > output.log 2>&1
```

## Pipes

Pipes (`|`) enable you to send the output of one command as the input to another:

```bash
command1 | command2
```

This passes the output of `command1` as input to `command2`.

## Conclusion

Understanding input/output redirection is crucial for efficient Linux scripting. Whether you are managing files, handling command output, or chaining commands together, the ability to control where data flows enhances the versatility of your scripts. Experiment with these redirection techniques to master their usage in your Linux scripts.
