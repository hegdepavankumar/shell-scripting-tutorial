## Capturing and Using Command Output in Linux



### 1. **Command Substitution:**

Command substitution allows you to capture the output of a command and use it as part of another command or store it in a variable.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

current_date=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
echo "Current date: $current_date"
```

Here, `$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")` captures the output of the `date` command and assigns it to the `current_date` variable.

### 2. **Using Backticks:**

Alternatively, you can use backticks for command substitution. However, it's recommended to use the `$()` syntax for better readability and nesting.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

files_count=`ls | wc -l`
echo "Number of files: $files_count"
```

### 3. **Capturing Multi-Line Output:**

To capture multi-line output, use double quotes around the command substitution.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

file_list="$(ls -l)"
echo -e "File List:\n$file_list"
```

The double quotes preserve the line breaks in the output, allowing for proper formatting.

### 4. **Redirecting Output to a Variable:**

You can redirect command output directly to a variable using the command substitution syntax.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

file_contents=$(cat example.txt)
echo "File Contents:\n$file_contents"
```

Here, the `cat` command output (contents of "example.txt") is stored in the `file_contents` variable.

### 5. **Command Output in Conditional Statements:**

Capture command output to make decisions in conditional statements.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if result=$(command_with_output); then
    echo "Command succeeded. Output: $result"
else
    echo "Command failed."
fi
```

Here, the output of `command_with_output` is captured, and the script responds based on the success or failure of the command.

### 6. **Using Command Output as Arguments:**

Pass the output of one command as an argument to another.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

directory=$(pwd)
echo "Current directory: $directory"

# Using the output as an argument
files_count=$(ls "$directory" | wc -l)
echo "Number of files in $directory: $files_count"
```

### 7. **Command Output in a Loop:**

Iterate over command output using a loop.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for file in $(ls); do
    echo "Processing file: $file"
    # Additional processing logic
done
```

This loop iterates over the files in the current directory using the output of the `ls` command.

### 8. **Error Handling:**

Capture both standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) for comprehensive error handling.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

result=$(command 2>&1)
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Command succeeded. Output: $result"
else
    echo "Command failed. Error: $result"
fi
```

Here, `2>&1` redirects stderr to stdout, and the exit code is checked for error handling.

### 9. **Security Considerations:**

When capturing command output from user input or external sources, validate and sanitize inputs to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

user_input="; echo 'Dangerous command';"
echo "User input: $user_input"

# Sanitize and validate input before using it
output=$(echo "$user_input" | tr -cd '[:alnum:]')
echo "Processed input: $output"
```

### 10. **Using Variables with Piped Commands:**

When using pipes (`|`) in commands, you can capture and use intermediate results in variables.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

files_with_txt_extension=$(ls | grep ".txt")
echo "Files with .txt extension: $files_with_txt_extension"
```

Here, the output of `ls` is piped to `grep` to filter files with a ".txt" extension, and the result is stored in the `files_with_txt_extension` variable.

Capturing command output is a powerful feature in Linux scripting, allowing you to build flexible and dynamic scripts that respond to the results of executed commands. Always consider error handling and security when working with command output in scripts.
