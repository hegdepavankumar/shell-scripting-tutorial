```

- `30` - Minutes field, indicating that the job should run when the minute is 30.
- `3` - Hours field, indicating that the job should run at 3 AM.
- `*` - Wildcard for the day of the month, meaning the job runs every day.
- `*` - Wildcard for the month, meaning the job runs every month.
- `*` - Wildcard for the day of the week, meaning the job runs every day of the week.
- `/path/to/your/command_or_script.sh` - The full path to the command or script you want to run.


Make sure to adjust the path and the script/command accordingly based on your requirements. Save the crontab entry using the `crontab -e` command.
