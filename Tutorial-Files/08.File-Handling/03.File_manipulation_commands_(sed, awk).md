# File Manipulation Commands: `sed` and `awk` in Linux Scripting

File manipulation commands such as `sed` (stream editor) and `awk` (text processing tool) are powerful tools for performing complex operations on text files. This tutorial will guide you through the usage of these commands in a Linux environment.

## `sed` - Stream Editor

### Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of the `sed` command is as follows:

```bash
sed OPTIONS 'COMMAND' FILE
```

Here, `OPTIONS` are various options you can pass to `sed`, `COMMAND` is the operation you want to perform, and `FILE` is the input file.

### Examples

#### Substituting Text

To replace occurrences of a specific string in a file, use the `s` (substitute) command:

```bash
sed 's/old_text/new_text/g' input.txt > output.txt
```

This replaces all occurrences of `old_text` with `new_text` in `input.txt` and writes the result to `output.txt`.

#### Deleting Lines

To delete lines matching a specific pattern, use the `d` (delete) command:

```bash
sed '/pattern/d' input.txt > output.txt
```

This deletes all lines containing the specified `pattern` from `input.txt` and writes the result to `output.txt`.

#### Adding and Appending Text

To add or append text to specific lines, use the `a` (append) and `i` (insert) commands:

```bash
sed '/pattern/a\
    new_text' input.txt > output.txt
```

This appends `new_text` after lines containing `pattern`.

### `awk` - Text Processing Tool

### Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of the `awk` command is as follows:

```bash
awk 'PATTERN { COMMAND }' FILE
```

Here, `PATTERN` is a condition that triggers the command, `COMMAND` is the action to be performed, and `FILE` is the input file.

### Examples

#### Printing Specific Columns

To print specific columns from a file, use the `{ print }` statement:

```bash
awk '{ print $2, $4 }' input.txt
```

This prints the second and fourth columns of each line in `input.txt`.

#### Conditionally Printing Lines

To print lines based on a condition, use an `if` statement:

```bash
awk '{ if ($3 > 50) print $0 }' input.txt
```

This prints the entire line if the value in the third column is greater than 50.

#### Calculating Sum or Average

To calculate the sum or average of a column, use variables and update them for each line:

```bash
awk '{ sum += $2 } END { print "Sum:", sum, "Average:", sum/NR }' input.txt
```

This calculates the sum and average of the values in the second column and prints the result at the end.

## Conclusion

`sed` and `awk` are powerful tools for file manipulation in Linux scripting. Whether you need to perform text substitutions, deletions, or complex text processing, these commands provide efficient solutions. Experiment with the examples provided to master the usage of `sed` and `awk` in your Linux scripts.
