# Reading from and Writing to Files in Linux Scripting

Working with files is a fundamental aspect of Linux scripting. This tutorial will guide you through the process of reading from and writing to files, exploring various methods and techniques in a Linux environment.

## Reading from Files

### Reading Entire File Content

To read the entire content of a file, you can use commands like `cat` or `echo` along with command substitution:

```bash
file_content=$(cat filename.txt)
echo "$file_content"
```

### Reading Line by Line

To read a file line by line, you can use a `while` loop with the `read` command:

```bash
while IFS= read -r line; do
    echo "Line: $line"
done < filename.txt
```

Here, `IFS` is set to preserve leading and trailing whitespaces in each line.

### Using `awk` and `sed`

Commands like `awk` and `sed` provide powerful text-processing capabilities. For example, using `awk` to print specific columns:

```bash
awk '{print $2}' filename.txt
```

### Checking File Existence

Before reading from a file, it's advisable to check if the file exists:

```bash
filename="example.txt"

if [ -e "$filename" ]; then
    file_content=$(cat "$filename")
    echo "$file_content"
else
    echo "File not found: $filename"
fi
```

## Writing to Files

### Writing Entire Content

To write content to a file, you can use redirection (`>` or `>>`):

```bash
echo "Hello, World!" > output.txt  # Overwrites the file
echo "Appended Text" >> output.txt  # Appends to the file
```

### Writing with `printf`

The `printf` command provides more formatting options:

```bash
printf "Name: %s\nAge: %d\n" "John" 25 > profile.txt
```

### Appending Multiple Lines

To append multiple lines to a file, you can use a here document:

```bash
cat <<EOF >> output.txt
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
EOF
```

### Using `echo`

The `echo` command is suitable for simple text:

```bash
echo "New line" >> output.txt
```

## Conclusion

Reading from and writing to files is a crucial part of Linux scripting. Whether you need to process log files, configure settings, or generate reports, mastering these file manipulation techniques will empower you to create versatile and efficient scripts. Experiment with these methods to handle file operations effectively in your Linux scripts.
